# Timers

Timers are finally here!  This automation will allow you to set timers, alarms and reminders by voice

## Requirements
* Must have Pyscript installed.  See [installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpJxZaisbGQ)
* Copy ```viewassist-timers.py``` into your pyscripts directory
* Create [alarm view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinki/View-Assist/viewassist-timers/View%20Assist%20dashboard%20and%20views/views/alarm/alarm.yaml)
## Dev Notes
* Things not working:
  * Cannot cancel alarm
  * Snooze (need to rewrite to use service instead of calendard)
* Pyscript functions will be renamed and additional function for cancelling will be added

This is a big work in progress.  By far this is the most complicated automation to date.  Thanks for your patience.  What is posted is fully working but not fully polished in terms of presentation and features.
