# Configuration

Browser Mod allows for hiding the default Home Assistant side and top menus allowing us to have a full screen experience.  After [setting up your View Assist dashboard](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/wiki/Lovelace-card-views#creating-a-new-dashboard-and-views), go back to Browser Mod from the sidebar menu.

Scroll down to Frontend Settings (1), and then expand the 'Hide sidebar' pulldown (2), click '+ Add Browser Setting', select the Fully Kiosk device you are setting up and turn 'Hide Sidebar' switch to on.  Repeat the same process for the 'Hide header' section.  Open the 'Default Dashboard' and set it to the dashboard you've created with your View Assist views.  This will ensure that the correct dashboard is displayed when booting the device.
