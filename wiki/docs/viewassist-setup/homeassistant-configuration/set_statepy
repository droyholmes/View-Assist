## View Assist device control through Python set_state
The View Assist satellite devices hold data and settings.  These devices and their attributes are updated using a python script called set_state .  This will involve file manipulation so if you need help you can watch this [video for installing file editor addon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncKWaLpJ1DQ) in HASSOS.  Here is how to install this python script for use with View Assist

* Download the set_state.py by right clicking this link and choose 'save link as': [set_state.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xannor/hass_py_set_state/master/python_scripts/set_state.py)
* Open the configuration.yaml file located in the 'homeassistant' config directory in a file editor
* Add a line to the bottom of the configuration file containing ```python_script:``` and save the file
* Go back into file editor and create a new folder in the config directory called ```python_scripts```
* Find that new folder and click it to enter
* Use the upload file option and upload the 'set_state.py' file into the 'python_scripts' folder you created
* Restart Home Assistant
* Check that the service is installed by going to Developer Tools -> Services and search for 'set_state'.  You should see the service listed in the results as 'Python Scripts: set_state'

Note that for HASSOS users the configuration folder shows up as ```homeassistant``` where other installs have this defined as ```/config```
