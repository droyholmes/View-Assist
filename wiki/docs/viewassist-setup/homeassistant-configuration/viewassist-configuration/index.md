The View Assist system is made up of several different components. These include:

- View Assist device configuration
- Dashboard and Views
- Control Automations
- Custom Sentences

The device configuration allows for per device settings, controls, and data storage. The dashboard allows for a universal display and control framework while the views allow for custom displays for presenting data. The control automations provide the means of switching between views dependent on the mode of the View Assist device. Custom sentences allow the user to speak a command and View Assist is able to execute that intent and display the view associated with the request.

Follow through with each of the setup pages and then start exploring the custom views and sentence automations and then start creating and sharing your own.
