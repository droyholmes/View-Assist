# Installing Browser Display Software
In order to render your Home Assistant dashboards in full screen on your Android tablet, you'll need an application that will render in a full screen fashion and provides additional functionality to make interacting with the dashboards easier. 

There are currently two applications supported:
- [Wallpanel](#wallpanel) - Recommended. Free to Use.
- [Fully Kiosk](#fullykiosk) - $10 USD / 7.90 â‚¬ per device for Plus features like remote management, capturing images from the webcam, etc.

## Wallpanel {#wallpanel}
Wallpanel is used for full screen display and is comparable to Fully Kiosk. The application is free to use and is the preferred app for View Assist use.

It may be useful to create a unique HA user for your WallPanel devices. This allows better control of security and prevents users from making accidental changes.

## Fully Kiosk {#fullykiosk}
The free version of the application will work for some functions but will display a watermark.  This is great for testing but for production you will more than likely want to support the developer by purchasing a license.  Money well spent.  Settings labeled (PLUS) require the license.

### Installation

Download and install the app via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ozerov.fully)

### Configuration

#### Web Content Settings -> 

  * Set 'Start URL' to your local HA server by name or your server address  (eg http://homeassistant.local:8123 or http://192.168.0.23:8123)
  * Set 'Username' to your HA username
  * Set 'Password' to your HA password

  
#### Advanced Web Settings ->

  * Turn on 'Ignore SSL Errors'  You may not need to do this but my old tablet did show notifications when trying to show Wikipedia images
  * Change color of 'Default Webview Background Color' to black or your favorite color

  
#### Universal Launcher ->

  * Applications to Run on Start in Background (PLUS) choose 'Ip Webcam'
  
#### Remote Administration (PLUS) ->

  * Turn on 'Enable Remote Administration'   This is needed to expose FK media player to Music Assistant addon
