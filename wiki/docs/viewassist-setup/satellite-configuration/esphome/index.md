# Configuring Your ESPHome device

ESPHome is an open source platform which allows users to incorporate ESP powered devices into Home Assistant.  Recently great work was done to allow for these devices to be used as voice satellites.  These devices have wake word built in so they do not require additional helpers like Stream Assist to process wake word.

For now we will defer you to ESPHome for satellite configuration and installation steps but in the future we plan to expand this section for complete documentation.

A working ESPHome satellite is all that is needed to move to the View Assist installation step.
